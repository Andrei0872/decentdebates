# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repo layout

Monorepo with `pnpm` workspaces and Turborepo.

- `apps/client` — Next.js frontend
- `apps/api` — NestJS backend
- `packages/db` — Postgres schema, Knex seeds, DB bootstrapping (`DbModule` imported by the API)
- `packages/shared-types` — Cross-app TypeScript contracts (no app code allowed here)
- `packages/eslint-config` — Shared ESLint config

## Boundaries

- Cross-app contracts belong in `packages/shared-types`, not duplicated between `apps/client` and `apps/api`.
- No imports across apps. Shared code must go through a package.
- All DB-related code belongs in `packages/db`.

## Commands

```bash
# Start everything (spins up Docker, builds packages, starts dev servers)
pnpm run dev

# Start only the API
pnpm run dev:api

# Build all packages/apps
pnpm build

# Lint / format (check)
pnpm lint
pnpm format

# Lint / format (fix)
pnpm lint:fix
pnpm format:fix

# Seed the database
pnpm run seed
pnpm run seed:file -- 03_debates.js   # run a single seed file

# Reset the DB (wipes volumes and restarts Postgres)
pnpm run db:reset
```

### Running tests

```bash
# API — unit (from apps/api or root)
pnpm --filter api test:unit

# API — integration (requires Docker; starts it automatically)
pnpm --filter api test:integration

# API — integration only (Docker must already be running)
pnpm --filter api test:integration:only

# Client — unit
pnpm --filter client test:unit

# Client — unit in watch mode
pnpm --filter client test:unit:watch

# Client — E2E (Playwright)
pnpm --filter client test:e2e
```

Unit spec files: `*.spec.ts` (under `src/`). Integration spec files: `*.int-spec.ts` (under `test/integration/`).

## Environment files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `packages/db/.env` | Local Postgres connection (copy from `.env.example`) |
| `apps/api/.env` | API config incl. `COOKIE_SECRET` (copy from `.env.example`) |
| `apps/api/.env.test` | Test overrides for integration tests (copy from `.env.test.example`) |
| `apps/client/.env.development` | Dev server URLs |
| `apps/client/.env.test.local` | E2E credentials (fill in after copying) |

## Architecture

### API (NestJS)

Authentication is session-based (express-session + Redis). `AuthenticateGuard` is registered as a global guard — all routes require authentication by default; use `@Public()` to opt out.

Domain modules under `src/entities/`: `debates`, `review`, `comment`, `moderator`, `notification`, `user`. Each follows the standard NestJS module/controller/service pattern.

`packages/db` is imported as `DbModule` and handles all DB access via raw `pg` queries (no ORM by design — see README research notes).

Real-time notifications are handled via Socket.io (`@nestjs/websockets`) and coordinated through `EventEmitterModule`.

### Client (Next.js + Redux)

State is managed with Redux Toolkit. Slices live in `src/store/slices/`: `debates.slice.ts`, `moderator.slice.ts`, `user.slice.ts`. `StoreProvider.tsx` and `AuthHydrator.tsx` wrap the app shell.

The rich-text editor throughout the app is Lexical (`@lexical/react`).

Drag-and-drop (argument reordering) uses `react-dnd`.

## Testing conventions

- Prefer integration tests for DB-heavy backend behavior over unit tests.
- Prefer E2E tests for multi-step workflows; don't duplicate coverage already in integration tests.
- Assert on observable behavior, not implementation details.
- Do not rely on specific seed data unless the test is explicitly about seeds.
- Extract DB helper queries into test helpers — don't inline them in specs.
- Keep test doubles minimal; stub only what isn't exercised.
- Reuse existing helpers and factories before adding new ones.

## Logging

- Use the NestJS logger, not `console.log` / `console.error`.
- Successful test runs should produce no routine log output.
